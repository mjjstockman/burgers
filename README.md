# Welcome to Burger Party
## Overview

**Burger Party** is a catering company providing Burgers, Fries and Drinks to parties.  

# The App

They want an app made where guests at the party can choose the food and drink they would like and a record made of the order, so they can prepare it for collection.  This benefits the customer as they can make an order through the app and not have to physically queue.  This also benefits the company by taking the pressure off of having a physical queue in front of them and allowing them to prepare the order in a more relaxed manner.
